    /// A wide, dark gradient on an 8-bit screen shows rings: each draw is rounded to whole steps
    /// of brightness as it is blended, and a glow across the whole screen changes by less than a
    /// step over dozens of pixels. Noise added afterwards (a grain layer) cannot help, because the
    /// glow has already been rounded by then. The noise has to be in the glow itself, so the
    /// rounding happens on a value that varies pixel to pixel: then neighbouring pixels round
    /// different ways and the eye sees the smooth average. That needs a texture as large as the
    /// glow is on screen, made once per layout on a worker thread (a few million pixels) and
    /// swapped in when ready; until then the stretched Art.Radial stands in.
    ///
    /// The noise is triangular, in steps of the texture's alpha, a fixed number of steps chosen
    /// so the final colour moves by one to two steps of brightness for every department's
    /// colours. It does not depend on the colour (the texture is white; the glow is tinted), so
    /// one texture serves every department at a given size, and switching department in the
    /// preview does not have to wait for a new one. The last few sizes are kept.
